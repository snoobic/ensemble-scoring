Data processing in ensemble scoring

Ensemble Scoring (ES) for protein crystal dynamics conformations using three scoring functions DSX (knowledge-based), X-Score (empirical), and ΔvinaRF20 (machine-learning-based). It only provides usage examples by scripts in the GitHub repository.



Requirements

1.Desmond 4.2

2.DSX(https://agklebe.pharmazie.uni-marburg.de/?lang=en)

3.X-Score(http://www.sioc-ccbg.ac.cn/?p=42&software=xscore&action=download)

4.ΔvinaRF20(https://github.com/chengwang88/deltavina)

5.Open Babel 2.3.2

6.Pymol 1.7



Data set

PDBbind core set v.2013(http://www.pdbbind.org.cn/index.php)



How to run

1.The 1.2-ns molecular dynamics simulations of 195 protein crystals were performed using Desmond 4.2 software. The size of the data of the MD simulations exceeded 140G. The Github's capacity is too small (~500M). We have selected the molecular dynamics data of two crystals (PDB ID:1a30 and 1bcu) as examples deposited on Baidu's Netdisk ( https://pan.baidu.com/s/1GVFzZD0fPYGhBDrxwROgVA; Extraction Code: jjgg ), which is available permanently.

2.Download perl_scripts_for_MD_conformations.zip;
